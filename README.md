# TrainTime

Enter trains with a destination, a frequency time in minutes, and the first arrival time and this app will calculate the next arrival time based on the frequency minutes input and also display how many minutes away from the next arrival.

Each train added appends under the others to save in a Current Train Schedule.

Also included is a clock at the top in CST so you can see the current time.


Chuga-Chuga-CHOO-CHOO!
Enjoy!
